PROJECT COLLABORATION TOOL

### What’s this all about?
We all know how group projects can get chaotic — tasks scattered across chats, progress
tracked in random Google Sheets, and no clear idea of who’s doing what. This tool is here to fix
that.

The Project Collaboration Tool is a full-stack web application designed to make teamwork
smoother and more organized. It brings everything — users, teams, projects, tasks, updates —
into one place. Whether you're assigning work, tracking progress, or checking a timeline of who
did what, this platform has got your back.
